# HyperLogLog

Why? idk, I saw breaking taps [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJYufx0bfpw) and thought it was cool

[paper he linked](https://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf)

[the wiki is a pretty good summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog)

I also found [arunma's article](https://www.arunma.com/2023/05/01/build-your-own-hyperloglog) very helpful for the rust stuff
